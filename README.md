This is a port of the Ray Wenderlich tutorial [ResearchKit Tutorial with Swift: Getting Started](http://www.raywenderlich.com/104575/researchkit-tutorial-with-swift) to Objective-C. It's not verbatim, but close. Any problems with the code are mine, not theirs. 

You will likely need to delete ResearchKit.xcodeproj from the project and re-add it on your own. The API is still in development, so this sample may not work against a different version of ResearchKit.
